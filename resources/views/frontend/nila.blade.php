                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a seasoned software engineer with over 15 years of experience
                    in the tech industry, having worked with leading global companies
                    such as Dell, Microsoft, and HP in Bangladesh. My journey in
                    technology has been shaped by a passion for innovation, inclusion,
                    and digital empowerment.

                    After gaining extensive experience in multinational corporations, I
                    transitioned into the startup ecosystem by joining Maya, an
                    initiative powered by

                    ) and The World Bank (<span><a

                    ), Maya was Bangladesh’s first digital platform designed by women,
                    for women, providing critical services through an innovative mobile
                    app (<span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maya.mayaapaapp&hl=en"

                    ).
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    In 2013, I founded
                    <span><a href="https://www.womenindigital.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Women in
                            Digital</a></span>
                    with the mission: “Bringing more women into tech and making them
                    financially independent through the Internet.” Recognizing diverse
                    educational backgrounds and regional differences, I developed
                    customized technical curricula to help women learn efficiently and
                    transition into digital careers. Since its inception, Women in
                    Digital has trained over 24,000 women and girls in Bangladesh, 5,300
                    in Nepal, 639 in Sri Lanka, 230 in India, 120 in Kenya, 80 in the
                    UK, and more than 10,000 globally through online platforms. More
                    than 16,000 of our trainees are now actively contributing to
                    Bangladesh’s digital economy
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    In my commitment to increasing women’s involvement in tech, I
                    organized the 1st National Women Hackathon in Bangladesh, the first
                    of its kind in South Asia. To encourage women’s participation, we
                    also organized various initiatives such as the Digital Innovation
                    Challenge for Women, the FemTech Challenge, programming contests,
                    and numerous workshops and awareness campaigns, all aimed at
                    empowering women in technology
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    To enhance women’s participation in the global tech industry, I
                    launched
                    <span><a href="https://www.luminadev.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lumina
                            Dev</a></span>, a 100% women-led digital agency based in Bangladesh, serving
                    clients from the USA, UK, and Japan. This initiative provides
                    employment opportunities for women while strengthening Bangladesh’s
                    global footprint in software development.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    To support women entrepreneurs, I founded
                    <strong>Women in E-Commerce</strong>, which now connects over 50,000
                    women-led SMEs across Bangladesh. We provide tailored training,
                    business support, and international market access, helping women
                    scale their businesses globally.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Additionally, I established <strong>Women in AgroTech</strong> to
                    empower marginalized communities. This initiative includes a
                    soil-testing mobile app that connects researchers, farmers, and
                    traders, fostering sustainable agricultural practices. The project
                    has secured impact investment from Oxfam International.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Understanding the need for online safety, I also launched
                    <strong>Women in Cybersecurity</strong>, an initiative dedicated to
                    protecting women in digital spaces through cybersecurity training
                    and advocacy.
